How to identify what pieces of data are states? Identify the ones that are not:

Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!
